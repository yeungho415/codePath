## App Brainstorming
    Favorite Applications
    1. Spotify
        - Personalized playlists: I love how Spotify uses my listening habits to create custom playlists for me.
        - Cross-platform syncing: The ability to start listening on my computer and continue on my phone without missing a beat is amazing.
    2. Instagram
        - Photo filters: Instagram's various filters allow me to quickly enhance my photos.
        - Stories: A fun and creative way to share my day-to-day life with my friends.
    3. LinkedIn
        - Networking: LinkedIn provides a professional platform to connect with colleagues, potential employers, and other professionals in my field.
        - Jobs feature: It's easy to search for and apply to jobs directly through LinkedIn. The recommendations are often quite accurate to my profile and interests.
        
    App Idea 
    I'd like to create a new app that merges the features of a to-do list with the motivational aspects of fitness tracking apps. The concept is a "Productivity Tracker" where users can create, track, and complete tasks much like a regular to-do list app. However, this app would also gamify productivity by incorporating features similar to those in fitness tracking apps.

    Users would earn points for completing tasks, maintain streaks for consistent productivity, and could compete with friends or co-workers. In addition, the app would provide insightful statistics about a user's productivity habits, allowing them to understand when they are most productive during the day or week, and tailor their work schedule accordingly.

    This is just a preliminary idea and I'd love to get feedback and refine it as we proceed with the course.
